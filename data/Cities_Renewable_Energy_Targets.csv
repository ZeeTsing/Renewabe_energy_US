In order to cover the entire demand for electricity in 2060 with energy from renewable sources, around 100 million CHF would have to be invested in new plants each year over the next fifty years.

The National Climate Change Secretariat (NCCS) and the National Research Foundation (NRF) has commissioned a technology roadmap in Solar PV, together with the Energy Market Authority (EMA) and the Economic Development Board (EDB) which charts out the RDD & deployment strategy for solar PV for the medium to long term.

We will continue to support the use of renewables by continuing to test-bed innovative energy technologies and business models.

Here is a link to the strategy: https://www.dorsetforyou.com/media/180518/Renewable-Energy---Bournemouth-Dorset-and-Poole-Renewable-Energy-Strategy-to-2020/pdf/Bournemouth__Dorset_and_Poole_Renewable_Energy_Strategy_to_2020.pdf  The aspirational target in the Bournemouth, Dorset and Poole Renewable Energy Strategy to 2020 is 7.5% of total energy consumption equivalent to 1,200GWh of renewable energy, from local on-shore generation by 2020. 546 GWh is equivalent to 3.4% of total energy consumption in February 2015, representing a significant increase from 0.95 % in January 2011. The Strategy covers the production of renewable electricity and renewable heat, within Dorset.   The exact amount of renewable energy which will need to be installed by 2020, to achieve national and international targets and to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, depends on actual future energy demand. If demand for energy falls, so too does the amount of heat, electricity and transport fuel which needs to be generated from renewable resources. This means that both renewable energy generation and energy efficiency measures to reduce demand, must be progressed in parallel. Within Dorset this Strategy will, therefore complement the existing Bournemouth, Dorset and Poole Energy Efficiency Strategy and Action Plan (2009) which is also being delivered by the Dorset Energy Partnership.","(50.719164, -1.880769)",

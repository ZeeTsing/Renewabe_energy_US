Actions include: assume operational authority and begin operations of an electric utility, and analyze local generation opportunities including combined heat and power, heating/cooling district analysis and energy storage infrastructure development; (3) Redesign the existing electricity delivery system to make it more reliable, more secure and more supportive of a diverse mix of electricity sources. Actions include: work with both institutional and private sector partners to pilot projects integrating local energy system designs with alternative electricity distribution systems, map critical community infrastructure and operations and identify opportunities to develop and deploy energy system upgrades that enable these sites to sustain operations during periods of power grid disruption, and launch the next round of community innovation investments through the Boulder Energy Challenge.

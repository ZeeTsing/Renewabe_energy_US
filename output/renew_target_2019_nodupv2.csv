On March 22, 2019, the District's Clean Energy DC Omnibus Amendment Act of 2018 became law, which enacted the most recent update to the city's Renewable Portfolio Standard, strengthening it to require 100% of electricity come from renewable sources by 2032, including 5.5% from local solar. The law also sets a longer-term local solar generation target of meeting 10% of electricity usage with local solar by 2041.  The RPS standard was put in place in 2005 and updated in 2008, 2011, and 2016. The 2016 amendment, known as the Renewable Portfolio Standard Expansion Amendment Act of 2016 also created a funding mechanism for the Solar for All program, which establishes a goal of putting solar on 100,000 low income households in the District. In 2017, more than 13.6% of total electricity use in the District was supplied by renewable energy, however this is a conservative and likely underestimation, as it only captures the compliance market. There is also a voluntary renewable market, which we have not reported here as we suspect there is some overlap between the two, and we erred on the side of not double-counting that generation.",District of Columbia,672228
